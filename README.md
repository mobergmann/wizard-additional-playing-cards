# wizard-additional-playing-cards
This is a collection of additional wizard playing card games.
These Cards focus on providing an advanced playing experience of the aniversary edition of the [Wizard game by Amigo](https://www.amigo-spiele.de/kartenspiele/wizard-25-jahre-edition_2101_1170).

# Using these Cards
You can chose a subset of the provided custom cards and add them to your Game. You might want to print the additional cards by a profesional printing company, to ensure, that your cards are visualy indistinguashable to your base wizard cards. Otherwise you might also want to print the whole deck (also the base cards).

# Submitting a new Card
Please submit a new Card idea via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mobergmann/wizard-additional-playing-cards/issues).
If the Idea is approved you can create a fork and add an PR.
But you don't have to create your own card. You can also ask for help and maybe someone other will create these.
